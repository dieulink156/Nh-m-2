}	Customers are becoming more drawn to the quality of service (QoS) offered by businesses in the present. However, the present day shows greater rivalry in offering clients technologically cutting-edge QoS. However, effective customer relationship management systems may help the organization attract new clients, preserve client connections, and enhance client retention by generating more revenue for the company's operations. Churners have always been a major problem for every business that offers services. Churning drives up a company's expenses while also lowering its profit margin. However, it is possible to forecast if a consumer wishes to cancel service using predictive analysis based on historical service usage, service performance, expenditure, and other behavioral patterns. The problem with churn analysis is that it can reveal unnecessary information when used on databases that are combined by a company that owns confidential information.

}	Churn prediction, or the task of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue use of a service, is an important and lucrative concern of firms in many different industries. As these firms collect an increasing amount of large-scale, heterogeneous data on the characteristics and behaviors of customers, new methods become possible for predicting churn. In this paper, we present a unified analytic framework for detecting the early
warning signs of churn, and assigning a “Churn Score” to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the particular individual will churn within a predefined amount of time. This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering, then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection, before feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning algorithms. Using several terabytes of data from a large
mobile phone network, our method identifies several intuitive - and a few surprising - early warning signs of churn, and our best model predicts whether a subscriber will churn with 89.4% accuracy.

}	To address the prominent problems faced by customer churn in telecom enterprise management, a telecom customer churn prediction model integrating GA-XGBoost and SHAP is proposed. By using the ADASYN algorithm for data processing on the unbalanced sample set; based on the GA-XGBoost model, the XGBoost algorithm is used to construct the telecom customer churn prediction model, and the hyperparameters of the model are optimized by using the genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that compared with traditional machine learning methods such as GBDT, decision tree, KNN and single XGBoost model, the improved XGBoost model has better performance in recall, F1 value and AUC value; the GA-XGBoost model is integrated with SHAP framework to analyze and explain the important features affecting telecom customer churn, which is more in line with the telecom industry to predict customer the actual situation of churn.

}	This chapter represents the business case in the telecommunication company called Veza, in domain of churn prediction and churn mitigation. The churn project was divided into few stages. Due to limited budget and cost optimization, stage one was concentrated on prospective customer value calculation model based on fuzzy expert system. This helps Veza company to find most valuable telecom subscribers. It also helped company to better understand subscriber portfolio structure. Developed fuzzy expert system also helped Veza company in detection of soft churn. Stage two is profiling and customer segmentation based on time series analysis which provided potential predictors for predictive churn model. The central stage was concentrated on developing traditional predictive churn model based on logistic regression. This calculated probability that subscribers will make churn in next few months. The final stage was dedicated to SNA (Social Network Analysis) model development which found out the most valuable customers from the perspective of existing subscriber network. This model gave the answer that subscribers have the greatest influence on other subscribers in a way what is dangerous if they leave Veza company because they will motivate other subscribers to do the same thing. All three stages made complete churn detection/mitigation solution which take into consideration past behaviour of subscribers, their prospective value, and their strength of influence on other subscribers. This project helped Veza company to decrease churn rate and it gave directions for better understanding customer needs and behaviour which were the base for new product development.

}	In today's business landscape, companies are facing significant difficulties in achieving positive client interactions and maintaining customers' satisfaction. As a result, businesses are striving to focus on every aspect related to customers and their behaviors to compete in the industry. This has become increasingly important for building customers' loyalties, given the many opportunities available to customize services or products for each customer. To prevent customers from becoming dissatisfied and leaving, businesses are deploying various techniques to efficiently predict customers' behaviors and identify those who may churn or stop using the company's services or products. The rise of machine learning applications has significantly contributed to addressing the challenge of predicting customers' churn rates. Researchers worldwide are now moving towards applying machine learning techniques in this area. This paper aims to present a review of various studies conducted from 2019 to 2022 that utilized machine-learning techniques to predict customers' churn in the telecom industry. The paper summarizes the different machine learning algorithms that are used for customers' churn prediction, with a particular focus on the telecom industry, as well as their accuracy, to provide insights into the effectiveness of these techniques in addressing customers' churn in the telecom industry.

}	Customer churn is considered as a significant issue in any industry due to various services, clients, and commodities. A massive amount of data is being created from e-commerce
services and tools. Analytical data and machine learning-based approaches have been implemented and utilized for CA (churn analysis) to design a plan, i.e., required to comprehend the rationale for the CC (Customer Churn) and to generate a profitable and actual customer holding program. The analytics and machine learning approaches mainly focus on customer profiling, CC classification, and detection of features that affect
churn. However, there are no specific techniques which can be used to determine how often a prospective customer is inclined to cover all the expenses whether they are churned or not. In this paper, an Optimized Kernel MSVM classification model is proposed to predict and classify churn. In the proposed work, MSVM algorithm has been used for classification. The kernel PCA and ALO optimizer method has been used for Feature
extraction and selection. The proposed model Optimized Kernel MSVM has been implemented on Tele-communication sector customer churn database to demonstrate the proposed model's generalization ability. The Optimized Kernel MSVM model has
achieved an accuracy of 91.05%, AUC 85% being maximum and reduced the RMSE score to 2.838. The implementation shows that both churn detection and classification may be examined at the same time while maintaining the highest overall accuracy and AUC.

}	Mobility has been one of the most impacted aspects of human life due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Home confinement, the lack of access to physical rehabilitation, and prolonged immobilization of COVID-19-positive patients within hospitals are three major factors that affected the mobility of the general population world-wide. Balance is one key indicator to monitor the possible movement disorders that may arise both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the coming future post-COVID-19. A systematic quantification of the balance performance in the general population is essential for preventing the appearance and progression of certain diseases (e.g., cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and musculoskeletal), as well as for assessing the therapeutic outcomes of prescribed physical exercises for elderly and pathological patients. The methodology proposed in this research can support the development of innovative technologies for smart and connected home-care solutions for physical therapy rehabilitation.

}	Enterprises have vast amounts of customer behavior data in the era of big data. How to take advantage of these data to evaluate custom forfeit risks effectively is a common issue faced by enterprises. Most of traditional customer churn predicting models ignore customer segmentation
and misclassification cost, which reduces the rationality of model. Dealing with these deficiencies, we established a research model of customer churn based on customer segmentation and misclas-
sification cost. We utilized this model to analyze customer behavior data of a telecom company. The results show that this model is better than those models without customer segmentation and misclassification cost in terms of the performance, accuracy and coverage of model

We consider both the dynamic and kinematic WMRs and their various tele-driving modes. By utilizing passive set-position modulation framework, we can guarantee two-port passivity or passivity/stability combination of the closed-loop tele-driving system with some theoretical performance measures. Experiments are performed to show the efficacy of the proposed frameworks using the Internet-emulated communication and a custom-built dynamic/kinematic WMR.

}	3D Tele-Immersion systems allow geographically distributed users to interact in a virtual world using their "live" 3D models. The capture, reconstruction, transfer, and rendering of these models introduce significant latency into the system. Implicit Latency (ℒ') can be estimated using system clocks to measure the time after the data was received from the RGB-D camera, till the request to render the result. The Observed Latency (ℒ) between a real world event and the event being rendered on the display, cannot be accurately represented by ℒ' since ℒ' ignores the time taken to capture, or update the display, etc. In this paper, a Visual Pattern based Latency Estimation (VPLE) approach is introduced to calculate the real world visual latency of a system without the need for any custom hardware. VPLE generates a constantly changing pattern that is captured and rendered by the 3DTI system. An external observer records both the pattern and the rendered results at high frame rates. ℒ is estimated by calculating the difference between the generated andrendered patterns. VPLE is extended to allow ℒ estimation between geographically distributed sites. Evaluations show that the accuracy of VPLE depends on the refresh rate of the pattern, and is within 4ms. ℒ of a distributed 3DTI system implemented on the GPU is significantly lower than the CPU implementation, and is comparable to video streaming. It is also shown that the ℒ' estimates for GPU based 3DTI implementations are off by almost 100% compared to the ℒ

}	This work proposes a shared-control tele-operation framework that adapts its cooperative properties to the estimated skill level of the operator. It is hypothesized that different aspects of an operator’s performance in executing a tele-operated path tracking task can be assessed through conventional machine learning methods using motion-based and task-related features. To identify performance measures that capture motor skills linked to the studied task, an experiment is conducted where users new to tele-operation, practice towards motor skill proficiency in 7 training sessions. A set of classifiers are then learned from the acquired data and selected features, which can generate a skill profile that comprises estimations of user’s various competences. Skill profiles are exploited to modify the behavior of the assistive robotic system accordingly with the objective of enhancing user experience by preventing unnecessary restriction for skilled users. A second experiment is implemented in which novice and expert users execute the path tracking on different pathways while being assisted by the robot according to their estimated skill profiles. Results validate the skill estimation method and hint at feasibility of shared-control customization in tele-operated path tracking.

}	Smart Ophthalmics© extends ophthalmic healthcare to people who operate/live in austere environments (e.g., military, third world, natural disaster), or are geographically dispersed (e.g., rural populations), where time, cost, and the possibility of travel/transportation make access to even adequate medical care difficult, if at all possible. Operators attach optical devices that act as ophthalmic examination extensions to smartphones and run custom apps to perform examinations of specific areas of the eye. The smartphone apps submit over wireless networks the collected examination data to a smart remote expert system, which provides in-depth medical analyses that are sent back in near real-time to the operators for subsequent triage.

}	Customer churn prediction is critical for telecommunication companies to retain users and provide customized services. In this paper, a particle classification optimization-based BP network for telecommunication customer churn prediction (PBCCP) algorithm is proposed, which iteratively executes the particle classification optimization (PCO) and the particle fitness calculation (PFC). PCO classifies the particles into three categories according to their fitness values, and updates the velocity of different category particles using distinct equations. PFC calculates the fitness value of a particle in each forward training process of a BP neural network. PBCCP optimizes the initial weights and thresholds of the BP neural network, and brings remarkable improvement on customer churn prediction accuracy.

}	Customer retention is one of the most important issues for companies. Companies always seek to reduce customer churn in order to increase the customer lifetime value and reduce the cost of acquisition of new customers. By focusing on customer churn prediction and identification, companies can predict in advance which customers are going to churn and therefore decrease customers churn rate through related personalized actions. The key issue here is how to predict customer churn at an early stage. This paper identifies related issues in customer churn prediction and provides new definitions and classifications on customer churn identification and strategies. This paper also establishes a customer churn prediction and response framework consists of three main stages: customer churn prediction, customer churn understanding and customer churn response. The framework presents the characteristics and challenges of related stages of customer churn as well. These outcomes can be used for customized or personalized product and service developments, to improve customer service efficiency and related decision-making more effective and more particularly enabling strategic promotion campaigns to customers with high churn risk.

}	In telecommunication, mobile operators prefer to acquire postpaid subscribers and increase their incoming revenue based on the usage of postpaid lines. However, subscribers tend to buy and use prepaid mobile lines because of the simplicity of the usage, and due to higher control over the cost of the line compared to postpaid lines. Moreover the prepaid lines have less paper work between the operator and subscriber. The mobile subscriber can end their contract, whenever they want, without making any contact with the operator. After reaching the end of the defined period, the subscriber will disappear, which is defined as “involuntary churn”. In this work, prepaid subscribers’ behavior are defined with their RFM data and some additional features, such as usage, call center and refill transactions. We model the churn behavior using Pareto/NBD model and with two benchmark models: a logistic regression model based on RFM data, and a logistic regression model based on the additional features. Pareto/NBD model is a crucial step in calculating customer lifetime value (CLV) and aliveness of the customers. If Pareto/NBD model proves to be a valid approach, then a mobile operator can define valuable prepaid subscribers using this and decide on the actions for these customers, such as suggesting customized offers.

The development of services for social inclusion and independent living is of paramount importance to enable the elderly to live in their homes autonomously as long as possible. Such a solution paves the way to a sustainable social and economic model where older adults develop self-confidence and promote their participation to the community life. This paper presents the hardware/software framework of a novel ICT system for active ageing support, which combines the potentialities of broadband internet services to the simplicity of TV use. User research in three European countries allowed to define several important services (healthcare, home monitoring, shopping, communication and social inclusion) to be provided through the developed platform. Its modularity, supported by the App paradigm, enables easy customization and future developments.

}	Nowadays, filtering and analyzing data coming from Tele* (i.e. telemedicine, telerehabiliation, telemonitoring, telecare, and teleassistance) systems is becoming more and more relevant. In fact, those systems gather a lot of data coming from patients through wearable, domotic, and environmental sensors, as well as questionnaires and interviews. The role of therapists and care givers is essential for remotely assisting the corresponding patients. Thus, intelligent solutions able to understand all those data and process them to keep therapists and caregivers aware about their assisted persons are needed. Moreover, friendly and useful tools for accessing and visualizing those data must be provided to therapists and caregivers. In this chapter, we present a generic Tele* solution that, in principle, may be customized to whatever kind of real scenarios to give a continuous and efficient support to therapists and caregivers. The aim of the proposed solution is to be as flexible as possible in order to be able to provide telerehabilitation, telemonitoring, teleassistance or a conjunction of them, depending on the real situation. Three customizations of the generic platform are also presented.

}	In building robotic systems that interact with people through speech, many robotics engineers are obliged to treat artificial speech recognition and synthesis as a black-box problem best left to speech engineers to solve. Yet speech engineers today typically do not have access to the kinds of expensive robots needed for this development. Progress on the human-robot speech interface thus suffers from something of a diffusion of responsibility. In an attempt to remedy the situation, we have developed a low-cost interactive embodied speech device. The device is constructed from off-the-shelf components and from 3D-printed and laser-cut parts. We make the files for the 3D and laser-cut parts freely available for download. In addition to offering basic assembled devices and kits for self-assembly, we provide an assembly guide and a shopping list of components a user will need in order to build, maintain, and customize their own device. We supply a basic software framework (in both Matlab and in C/C++), and template code for a ROS node for interfacing with the device. The idea is to establish a standard and accessible hardware platform with an open-source foundation for the sharing of ideas and research.

}	One of the major problems in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is the use of machine learning model as a black box, even though it might be helpful in a few cases but understanding the internal structure and the operating mechanism will assist the user to tweak the variables in a more efficient and productive manner. In this paper we have introduced the working of an artificial neural network (ANN) by taking the example of a three layered neural network. The entire mathematics behind the working of neural network along with the different evaluation metrics required to assess the performance of the model are discussed in this paper. We have also created a custom neural network from scratch and compared it with the keras based model on three different datasets - susy dataset [8], cardiovascular dataset [6], churn dataset [7]. The results obtained demonstrates that the overall performance of both the models are almost identical which gives an idea that it is possible to train a neural network from scratch without the use of any framework.

}	With the development of big data and deep learning technology, big data and deep learning technology have also been applied to the marketing field, which was a part of business administration. Customer churn management is one of the most important areas of marketing. In this paper, we proposed a method to prevent customer churn and increase purchase conversion rate by issuing customized discount coupons to customers with high churn rate based on big data in real time. After segmenting customer segments with two-dimensional segment analysis, a real-time churn rate estimation model based on clickstream data was generated for each segment. After that, we issued customized coupons to our customers. Finally, we tested the conversion rate and sales growth. A two-dimensional cluster analysis-based churn rate estimation combined with a recommendation system was found to be significantly more useful than the respective simple models. Using this proposed model, it is possible to increase sales by automatically estimating the customer’s churn probability and shopping propensity without the burden of marketing costs in the online shopping mall.

Literature presents different sensing mobile applications for digital phenotyping, however they are not extensible and can not be customized for use in other research. In this paper, we propose OpenDPMH, a framework for developing mobile sensing applications able to collect contextual data in order to produce useful user information that represent situations of interest for mental health professionals and researchers, such as human behaviors and habits. Our solution is extensible and reusable, as it allows the inclusion of modules for collecting and processing new raw context data with features for data distribution. By implementing a case study, we demonstrate that OpenDPMH is suitable for the development of DPMH mobile applications. Moreover, we carried out experiments to evaluate the energy consumption on smartphones, which demonstrate a low battery cost to run applications developed using the proposed framework.

}	Stochastic classifiers arise in a number of machine learning problems, and have become especially prominent of late, as they often result from constrained optimization problems, e.g. for fairness, churn, or custom losses. Despite their utility, the inherent randomness of stochastic classifiers may cause them to be problematic to use in practice for a variety of practical reasons. In this paper, we attempt to answer the theoretical question of how well a stochastic classifier can be approximated by a deterministic one, and compare several different approaches, proving lower and upper bounds. We also experimentally investigate the pros and cons of these methods, not only in regard to how successfully each deterministic classifier approximates the original stochastic classifier, but also in terms of how well each addresses the other issues that can make stochastic classifiers undesirable.

}	Research on material characterization has received an increasing amount of attention recently. In several application scenarios, it is essential to effectively estimate the physical properties of objects without coming into contact with them (e.g., tele-operated or autonomous robotics). This article presents the Haptic Eye: a framework using active thermography that uses a custom multichannel neural network approach to perform classification between samples and regression toward their thermal properties. This neural network structure is uniquely suited for effective processing of thermographic data. The framework is realized, implemented, and evaluated with a set of ten samples with diverse thermal/physical properties. Experimental results on a realization of the framework validate this approach, with a 92.20% classification accuracy using multichannel neural network with majority vote, as well as more than 99.6% R 2 -fit with respect to three different thermal properties, namely thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and thermal effusivity (which is very useful to define thermal exchange during physical interaction).

}	Successful manipulation of unknown objects requires an understanding of their physical
properties. Infrared thermography has the potential to provide real-time, contactless material characterization for unknown objects. In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes active thermography and custom multi-channel neural networks to perform classification between samples and regression towards the density property. With the help of an off-the-shelf technology to estimate the volume of the object, the proposed approach is capable of estimating the weight of the unknown object. We show the efficacy of the infrared thermography approach to a set of ten commonly used materials to achieve a 99.1% R2-fit for predicted versus actual density values. The system can be used with tele-operated or autonomous robots to optimize grasping techniques for unknown objects
without touching them.

}	We report on the design, specification and implementation of a situation awareness module used for assistive systems in manufacturing, in the context of Industry 4.0. A recent survey of research done in Germany and Europe, concerning assistive technology in industry shows a very high potential for “intelligent assistance” by combining smart sensors, networking and AI. While the state of the art concerning actual technology in industrial use points more towards userfriendly, speech-based interaction with personal assistants for information retrieval (typically of in-house documentation), the research presented here addresses an enterprise-level assistance system that is supported by a number of specialized Assistance Units that can be customized to the end users’ specifications and that range from tutoring systems to tele-robotics. Key to the approach is situation awareness, which is achieved through a combination of a-priori, task knowledge modelling and dynamic situation assessment on the basis of observation streams coming from sensors, cameras and microphones. The paper describes a working fragment of the industrial task description language and its extensions to cover also the triggering of assistive interventions when the observation modules have sent data that warrants such interventions.

}	As one digital intervention for informal caregivers, the ‘Angehörigenampel’ (caregivers’ traffic-light) was developed, which is able to assess the physical and psychological burden of caregivers. This can help to counteract the health effects of caregiving burden early on before it is too late. The development of the digital intervention as a WordPress-plugin was kept generic so that it can easily be adapted to other languages on further websites. The ‘intervention as a plugin’ approach demonstrates an easy and flexible way of deploying eHealth interventions to other service providers, especially from other countries. The implementation barriers for other service providers are low enough for them to be able to easily integrate the eHealth intervention on their website, enabling more caregivers to benefit from the disseminated eHealth intervention.
